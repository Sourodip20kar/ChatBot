//The presence of a tsconfig.json file in a directory indicates that the directory is the root of a TypeScript project. 
/*
The tsconfig.json file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.

JavaScript projects can use a jsconfig.json file instead, which acts almost the same but has some JavaScript-related compiler flags enabled by default.
